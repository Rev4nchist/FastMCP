## üß¨ **EXPERIMENT #1: PERSONAL CONTEXT MANAGER**

### **Problem Statement**
Context loss is the silent killer of productivity in AI-assisted work. Conversations lose continuity, decisions lack historical reasoning, and institutional knowledge evaporates when people leave.

### **Solution Architecture**

#### **Core Context Types**
```python
class ContextType(str, Enum):
    CONVERSATION = "conversation"    # Important discussions
    DECISION = "decision"           # Choices made and reasoning
    PROJECT = "project"             # Project context over time
    TASK = "task"                   # Task context and progress
    INSIGHT = "insight"             # Breakthrough moments
    RELATIONSHIP = "relationship"   # People and connections
```

#### **Intelligent Features**
- **üîç Natural Language Search**: Query entire context history
- **üîó Context Connections**: Link related contexts together
- **‚ö° Priority Classification**: Critical/High/Medium/Low
- **üè∑Ô∏è Flexible Tagging**: Categorization system
- **üìä Rich Metadata**: Extensible key-value storage
- **üíæ Persistent Storage**: `~/.eve-mcp-lab/context/`

#### **MCP Tools Available**
1. `add_context()` - Store new context with metadata
2. `search_context()` - Natural language search across contexts
3. `get_recent_context()` - Retrieve recent activity
4. `get_context_details()` - Detailed context information
5. `update_context()` - Modify existing contexts
6. `get_context_stats()` - Usage analytics and insights

### **Technical Implementation**

#### **Data Model**
```python
@dataclass
class ContextItem:
    id: str                      # Unique identifier
    type: ContextType           # Context classification
    title: str                  # Brief title
    content: str               # Detailed content
    priority: Priority         # Importance level
    created_at: datetime       # Creation timestamp
    updated_at: datetime       # Last modification
    tags: List[str]           # Categorization tags
    connections: List[str]     # Related context IDs
    metadata: Dict[str, Any]   # Extensible metadata
```

#### **Storage & Persistence**
- **Format**: JSON serialization with datetime handling
- **Location**: `~/.eve-mcp-lab/context/context_store.json`
- **Backup Strategy**: Version control integration ready
- **Scalability**: Designed for database migration (PostgreSQL/Vector DB)

#### **Search Algorithm**
- **Method**: String matching across title, content, and tags
- **Future Enhancement**: Vector similarity search for semantic matching
- **Sorting**: Chronological by update time
- **Filtering**: By context type, priority, date ranges
