# 🎯 MCP Development Methodology: The EVE Framework
## *A Complete Guide to Building Production-Ready MCP Servers*

## 🧠 Understanding MCP Architecture

### What MCP Actually Does
The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is the "USB-C for AI" - it creates a standardized way for AI models (Claude, GPT, etc.) to connect to external tools, data, and services. Think of it as an **API gateway specifically designed for LLM interactions**.

```
[AI Model] ←→ [MCP Client] ←→ [MCP Server] ←→ [Your Tools/Data/APIs]
     ↑              ↑              ↑              ↑
   Claude      Built into      Your Custom      External
  /Cursor      Claude/Cursor     MCP Server      Services
```

### The Three MCP Primitives

1. **Tools** (Functions the AI can call)
   - Like POST/PUT endpoints
   - Execute actions, computations, side effects
   - Return results to the AI

2. **Resources** (Data the AI can read)
   - Like GET endpoints
   - Provide information, documents, context
   - Can be static or dynamic (templates)

3. **Prompts** (Reusable interaction patterns)
   - Pre-defined conversation starters
   - Standardized ways to interact with your tools

## 🎯 The EVE MCP Development Framework

### Phase 1: Opportunity Identification

#### 1.1 The "Pain Point Audit"
Ask these questions:
- **What repetitive tasks** are eating your time?
- **What information** do you frequently need but can't easily access?
- **What decisions** require data from multiple sources?
- **What workflows** involve manual steps between systems?
- **What context** gets lost between conversations/sessions?

#### 1.2 The "AI-Worthy Test"
A task is MCP-worthy if:
- ✅ **Repeatable**: You do it more than once
- ✅ **Data-Dependent**: Requires specific information
- ✅ **Context-Sensitive**: Benefits from conversation context
- ✅ **Cross-System**: Involves multiple tools/services
- ✅ **Decision-Support**: Helps make better choices faster

#### 1.3 Opportunity Categories

**Personal Productivity**
- Task management integration
- Calendar/scheduling automation
- File organization and search
- Note-taking and knowledge management
- Personal analytics and tracking

**Team Coordination**
- Project status aggregation
- Communication summarization
- Resource allocation tracking
- Decision documentation
- Progress reporting

**Executive Intelligence**
- KPI monitoring and alerts
- Market intelligence gathering
- Competitive analysis automation
- Strategic decision support
- Performance dashboard creation

**System Integration**
- API aggregation and normalization
- Data pipeline monitoring
- Service health checking
- Automated reporting
- Cross-platform synchronization

### Phase 2: API Discovery & Analysis

#### 2.1 REST API Goldmines
Look for these API characteristics:
- **Well-documented** (OpenAPI/Swagger preferred)
- **Stable endpoints** (versioned APIs)
- **Rich data models** (detailed responses)
- **Authentication supported** (API keys, OAuth)
- **Rate limits reasonable** (won't get blocked)

#### 2.2 FastMCP's Auto-Generation Magic
FastMCP can automatically convert REST APIs to MCP servers:

```python
# Auto-generate from OpenAPI spec
mcp_server = FastMCP.from_openapi(
    openapi_spec=api_spec,
    client=httpx_client
)

# Auto-generate from FastAPI app
mcp_server = FastMCP.from_fastapi(
    app=fastapi_app,
    name="Generated MCP Server"
)
```

#### 2.3 High-Value API Categories

**Productivity APIs**
- Google Workspace (Docs, Sheets, Calendar)
- Microsoft 365 (Outlook, Teams, SharePoint)
- Notion, Airtable, Monday.com
- Slack, Discord, Zoom

**Data & Analytics**
- Financial APIs (Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance)
- Social media APIs (Twitter, LinkedIn)
- Analytics APIs (Google Analytics, Mixpanel)
- Weather, news, market data

**Developer Tools**
- GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket
- CI/CD platforms (Jenkins, GitHub Actions)
- Monitoring (Datadog, New Relic)
- Cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP)

### Phase 3: MCP Tool Design

#### 3.1 Tool Categorization Strategy

**Action Tools** (Do something)
```python
@mcp.tool
def send_email(to: str, subject: str, body: str) -> str:
    """Send an email via API"""
    # Implementation
```

**Query Tools** (Get information)
```python
@mcp.tool
def get_project_status(project_id: str) -> dict:
    """Retrieve current project status"""
    # Implementation
```

**Analysis Tools** (Process data)
```python
@mcp.tool
def analyze_performance(data: list) -> dict:
    """Analyze performance metrics"""
    # Implementation
```

**Orchestration Tools** (Coordinate multiple actions)
```python
@mcp.tool
def create_project_workflow(name: str, stakeholders: list) -> str:
    """Create complete project setup across multiple systems"""
    # Implementation
```

#### 3.2 Tool Design Principles

**Atomic but Powerful**
- Each tool does ONE thing well
- But that one thing should be meaningfully useful
- Avoid micro-tools that require many calls

**Context-Aware**
- Accept context parameters when needed
- Use the FastMCP Context object for logging/sampling
- Store and retrieve relevant state

**Error-Resilient**
- Handle API failures gracefully
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Implement retry logic where appropriate

**Performance-Conscious**
- Cache expensive operations
- Use async/await for I/O operations
- Respect API rate limits

#### 3.3 Resource Design Strategy

**Static Resources** (Fixed data)
```python
@mcp.resource("config://api-endpoints")
def get_api_endpoints():
    """Available API endpoints"""
    return {"endpoints": [...]}
```

**Dynamic Resources** (Template-based)
```python
@mcp.resource("project://{project_id}/status")
def get_project_status(project_id: str):
    """Get real-time project status"""
    # Implementation
```

### Phase 4: Architecture Patterns

#### 4.1 The "Hub-and-Spoke" Pattern
For executive/team tools:
```python
# Main hub server
hub_mcp = FastMCP("Executive Hub")

# Mount specialized servers
hub_mcp.mount("finance", finance_mcp)
hub_mcp.mount("projects", project_mcp)
hub_mcp.mount("hr", hr_mcp)
```

#### 4.2 The "Pipeline" Pattern
For data processing workflows:
```python
@mcp.tool
def analyze_pipeline(data_source: str) -> str:
    """Execute complete data analysis pipeline"""
    raw_data = extract_data(data_source)
    cleaned_data = clean_data(raw_data)
    insights = analyze_data(cleaned_data)
    report = generate_report(insights)
    return report
```

#### 4.3 The "State Machine" Pattern
For complex workflows:
```python
class WorkflowState(Enum):
    PLANNING = "planning"
    EXECUTING = "executing"
    REVIEWING = "reviewing"
    COMPLETED = "completed"

@mcp.tool
def advance_workflow(workflow_id: str, action: str) -> str:
    """Advance workflow to next state"""
    # State machine logic
```

### Phase 5: Development Process

#### 5.1 The EVE Development Cycle

**1. Discover** (Identify the opportunity)
- Pain point analysis
- API research
- Stakeholder interviews

**2. Design** (Plan the MCP architecture)
- Tool/resource mapping
- Data flow design
- Error handling strategy

**3. Develop** (Build the MCP server)
- Start with simple tools
- Add complexity incrementally
- Test each tool individually

**4. Deploy** (Make it production-ready)
- Add authentication
- Implement monitoring
- Create documentation

**5. Distribute** (Scale to team/organization)
- Package for easy installation
- Create onboarding materials
- Monitor adoption and feedback

#### 5.2 Testing Strategy

**Unit Testing**
```python
async def test_tool():
    result = await mcp_server._call_tool("tool_name", {"param": "value"})
    assert result.success
```

**Integration Testing**
```python
async def test_api_integration():
    # Test with real APIs (in test environment)
```

**User Acceptance Testing**
- Test with actual users
- Gather feedback on tool usefulness
- Iterate based on real usage patterns

### Phase 6: Deployment & Scaling

#### 6.1 Production Considerations

**Authentication**
```python
from fastmcp.server.auth import EnvBearerAuthProvider

mcp = FastMCP(
    "Production Server",
    auth=EnvBearerAuthProvider()
)
```

**Middleware**
```python
from fastmcp.server.middleware import LoggingMiddleware, RateLimitMiddleware

mcp.add_middleware(LoggingMiddleware())
mcp.add_middleware(RateLimitMiddleware(requests_per_minute=100))
```

**Monitoring**
```python
@mcp.tool
async def monitored_tool(param: str, ctx: Context) -> str:
    ctx.info(f"Tool called with param: {param}")
    # Tool implementation
    ctx.info("Tool completed successfully")
```

#### 6.2 Distribution Strategy

**Personal Use**
- Single-user installation
- Local file storage
- Simple configuration

**Team Use**
- Shared server deployment
- Centralized authentication
- Team-specific configurations

**Enterprise Use**
- High availability deployment
- Enterprise authentication (SSO)

## 🚀 Common MCP Patterns & Templates

### Pattern 1: API Wrapper
```python
class APIWrapper:
    def __init__(self, base_url: str, api_key: str):
        self.client = httpx.AsyncClient(
            base_url=base_url,
            headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"}
        )

@mcp.tool
async def api_call(endpoint: str, params: dict = {}) -> dict:
    """Generic API call wrapper"""
    response = await wrapper.client.get(endpoint, params=params)
    return response.json()
```

### Pattern 2: Data Aggregator
```python
@mcp.tool
async def aggregate_metrics(sources: List[str]) -> dict:
    """Aggregate data from multiple sources"""
    results = {}
    for source in sources:
        results[source] = await get_source_data(source)
    return aggregate_data(results)
```

### Pattern 3: Workflow Orchestrator
```python
@mcp.tool
async def execute_workflow(workflow_name: str, params: dict) -> str:
    """Execute a predefined workflow"""
    workflow = get_workflow(workflow_name)
    for step in workflow.steps:
        result = await execute_step(step, params)
        params.update(result)  # Pass results to next step
    return "Workflow completed successfully"
```
