# 🧪 EVE-MCP-LAB: Personal AI Toolkit Development

**Experimental MCP Server Development Workspace**

This repository is our laboratory for building custom MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers, starting with Personal AI Toolkit prototypes and eventually scaling to Executive Team management suites.

## 🎯 Mission Statement

Build connected webs of AI intelligence that help teams:
- **Interact** more effectively with context-aware tools
- **Make decisions** faster with intelligent filtering
- **Act rapidly** on insights without bureaucratic friction
- **Filter BS** and focus on work that actually matters

## 🔬 Current Lab Status

**Phase 1**: Personal AI Toolkit Development
- Testing FastMCP framework capabilities
- Building custom tools for individual productivity workflows
- Establishing patterns and best practices

**Future Phases**: 
- Executive Team decision-making acceleration tools
- Cross-functional workflow orchestration
- Intelligent context management systems

## 🛠️ Based on FastMCP v2.0

This lab is built on top of [FastMCP](https://gofastmcp.com) - the production-ready framework for building MCP servers and clients. FastMCP v2.0 provides:

- **Pythonic Interface**: Simple decorators for tools, resources, and prompts
- **Production Features**: Auth, middleware, deployment, testing
- **Server Composition**: Mount multiple MCP servers together
- **Auto-generation**: Convert REST APIs to MCP servers
- **Full Ecosystem**: Both server and client capabilities

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv pip install fastmcp

# Run a simple server
fastmcp run examples/simple_echo.py

# Explore the examples
ls examples/
```

## 🧬 Lab Experiments

Our experimental MCP servers will be organized in the `lab/` directory:

- `lab/personal/` - Personal productivity tools
- `lab/executive/` - Executive team management tools  
- `lab/integration/` - Cross-system integration tools
- `lab/research/` - Experimental and prototype tools

## 📊 Success Metrics

- **Tool Adoption**: How often are our custom tools used?
- **Decision Speed**: How much faster are decisions made?
- **Context Quality**: How well do tools maintain and share context?
- **Workflow Efficiency**: How much manual work is eliminated?

## 🎭 Lab Philosophy

*"Test on ourselves first, scale to teams second, revolutionize executive decision-making third."*

Every tool we build should:
1. Solve a real problem we experience
2. Be production-ready from day one
3. Scale elegantly to team environments
4. Maintain context across interactions
